## 5. Add Features to Your Kernel
Now that you have a basic kernel running, you can start adding features:

Interrupts: Handle hardware interrupts (e.g., keyboard input, timer interrupts).
Memory Management: Implement paging and memory allocation.
Multitasking: Implement process scheduling and multitasking.
File Systems: Add support for file systems (e.g., FAT, ext2).

## 6. Continue Learning and Expanding

Here are some areas you can expand upon:

Writing Drivers: Implement drivers for hardware like the keyboard, display, or disk drives.
System Calls: Create an API for user-space programs to interact with the kernel.
Networking: Implement networking protocols like TCP/IP for communication.
Additional Resources:
OSDev Wiki: A fantastic resource for OS development tutorials and guides.
"Operating Systems: Design and Implementation" by Tanenbaum: This book uses Minix (a Unix-like OS) and provides great insights into OS concepts.
"The Linux Kernel Development" by Robert Love: Great if you want to dive into kernel development based on Linux.
